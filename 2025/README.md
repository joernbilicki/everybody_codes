# The Song of Ducks and Dragons

## Born of Fire

The night is warm, and the moonlight lazily spills over the rooftops of a small village hidden deep within the mountains. The blacksmith is finishing his final task in the forge, eager for a hot meal after a long day battling iron and smoke.

As he lays down his hammer for a well-earned rest, something on the forge’s doorstep catches his eye - an egg. But not just any egg. It is far larger than any he has ever seen, its shell shimmering with shades of black, gold, and green. The embers in the hearth are still glowing, so he places the egg inside, thinking he’ll enjoy it with a thick slice of bread in a short while.

To his astonishment, even after an hour in the flames, the egg remains almost cold - as if fire holds no power over it. He stokes the forge to its fiercest heat once more, but the egg remains unchanged. He gives up for the night, hoping it will be ready for breakfast by morning.

As the village slumbers, the shell suddenly begins to crack. From within emerges… a dragon? A duck? Or perhaps something caught between the two? The hatchling’s small, glistening scales are shaped like feathers, and its wings seem far too large for such a tiny creature.

Do you think you are the blacksmith who discovered this strange egg? Oh no, no! You are the creature itself, newly born into the world. But who or what are you? Where have you come from? What destiny awaits you?
